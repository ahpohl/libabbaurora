/** @brief Communication protocol between host and supervisor microprocessor 
 
    The communication between host and processor works via a serial interface RS485 or RS232.

    Configuration parameters in both cases are:
    - 19200 baud (default value)
    - 1 stop bit
    - no parity

    If the device has a RS485 interface, the default serial bus address is 2.

    The communication protocol uses fixed length transmission messages (8 bytes + 2 bytes for checksum). The structure of the answer also has fixed length (6 bytes + 2 bytes for checksum).
